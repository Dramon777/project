1. General provisions.

1.1. Two people are playing. The game is played on a special board divided into two
halves. The number of checkers on the board is 15 for each player, which are placed on
their part of the board along the right side. The players have different sets of checkers,
usually black and white. The number of dice is 2. The players take turns throwing dice.

2. The meaning of the game.

2.1. The player must complete a full circle with all checkers (counterclockwise),
enter the "house" with them and "throw" them before the opponent does.
 The last quarter of the playing field is considered the "home" for each player â€”
the "house of whites" - the IV quarter and the "house of blacks" - the II quarter.

2.2. The term "throw away" means to make a move with a checker so that it
ends up outside the board. You can "throw away" checkers only after
 after all the checkers "came to the house."

3. The drawing.

3.1. The player throws two dice at the same time. After the throw, the player moves
any of his checkers by the number of holes equal to the dropped number of one of the zars,
and then any one checker by the number of holes equal to the dropped number of the other
zar. That is, if "three" fell out at one dawn and "five" at the other, then, accordingly,
you can move one of your checkers to three holes and the other to five holes.
In this case, you can move one checker to eight holes. Which move to make first,
the larger number that falls out or the smaller one, does not matter. At the same time,
you can take only one checker from the head.


3.2. If the same number of points (jackpot) falls on both rounds, then the player
plays as if he threw 4 zars and can make 4 moves.

3.3. It is forbidden to put up a block (barrier; bridge) of six checkers. But it is
not forbidden to build blocks of 6 checkers, however, all fifteen of the opponent's
checkers cannot be locked. You have the right to build a barrier of six checkers
only if at least one of the opponent's checkers is in front of this barrier.

3.4. If the opponent's checkers occupy six squares in front of any checker,
then it turns out to be locked.

3.5. If the checkers are locked so that the player cannot make a single move for the
number of points that he threw away (the checkers "do not go"), then the player's
points disappear, and the checkers do not move at all.

3.6. An arbitrary number of checkers can be placed on one field.
You cannot put your own checker on the hole occupied by the opponent. In a situation where
checkers do not go, that is, the player cannot move them by the number of holes that fell
on the balls (the checkers fall on the occupied holes), all points disappear, and the player
skips a turn. In a situation where you can make a move on the number of holes that fell on
one of the rounds, and you cannot move the checker to the number of holes that fell on the other
dawn, only a possible move is performed, and the points of the second are lost. The player cannot
give up a full turn, even if he doesn't benefit from it.

3.7. The output of checkers is as follows. The player has the right to remove a checker from the board,
 which stands on the hole corresponding to the number of points thrown at the start. For example, if
6-3 falls out, the player can remove one checker from the 6th field and one checker from the 3rd field
from the board.

3.8. In the process of removing checkers from the house, the player has the right to use the points that
fell out at the beginning, at his discretion: he can play a checker in the house or throw it away.
In the process of removing checkers from one's own house, it is allowed to remove checkers from the
fields of the lowest a discharge, if there are no checkers in the fields of the highest grade. For example,
if 6-5 fell at the beginning, and there are no checkers on fields 6 and 5, then the player can take two
checkers out of the house from the next in order, the fourth field (hole), if there are no checkers there,
then from the third, if not there, then from the second, etc.

The party is ending.
